# Creating a new ThickNumber subtype

Create your type by subtyping `ThickNumber{T}`:

```julia
struct MyType{T<:Real} <: ThickNumber{T}
    # you can have whatever fields you need...
    a::T
    b::T
end
```

If you only intend to support, say, `Float64`, you can use `struct MyType <: ThickNumber{Float64} ... end`: the key point is that the `T` in `ThickNumber{T}` should encode the [`valuetype`](@ref).

The following interface functions must be defined:

- [`loval(x)`](@ref): should return the lower span (i.e., the "lower bound" if such bounds are strict).
- [`hival(x)`](@ref): should return the upper span.
- any arithmetic operations you need, e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`

The implementation of these functions must satisfy certain requirements spelled out in the documentation of each of these functions.

If possible, you should also define:

- [`lohi(MyType{T}, lo, hi)`](@ref): construct `x` from two numbers specifying the lower and upper spans.

If you cannot define this for your type (e.g., `MyType` requires more than two arguments to construct), it is likely that you'll have to specialize some of the [User API](@ref) functions for `MyType`, since the default implementations of some of them rely on `lohi`.

There are also numerous optional methods you can specialize if it makes `MyType` operate more
efficiently. For example, a gaussian random variable package might want to implement [`midrad(MyType{T}, center, Ïƒ)`](@ref) to construct values directly, assuming this is the natural parametrization
of this type.

## Ensuring compliance with the ThickNumbers interface

The `ThickNumbersInterfaceTests` package can be used to determine whether your implementations comply with the requirements.  As it is possible that this test suite will evolve and add new requirements,
be sure to use `[compat]` bounds to specify the major version number of `ThickNumbersInterfaceTests` that your implementation satisfies.
